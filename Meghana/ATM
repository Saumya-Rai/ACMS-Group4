class ATM{
int Current_Amount; //cash holding in terms of denominations?
int Current_state;//working or not working or running out of cash
int pin;//atm pin
int amount;//for withdrawing or transfer


boolean withdraw_Cash(pin,amount){//returns true if successful} //Shouldnt it have card number also? I thought we would insert the card,so we don't enter it manually
String Get_MiniStatement(pin){} //+ card number
}

How can it be extended to a kiosk?

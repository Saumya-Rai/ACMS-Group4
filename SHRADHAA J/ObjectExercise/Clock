class Clock
{
  int hours;
  int minutes;
  int seconds;
  boolean state; //running or not //Avoid state. seems very generic...
  
  void increment_time(); //increments seconds, minutes and hours //wouldnt it take arguments of how much to increment by?
  void replace_battery(boolean state);// why no return values?
}

extend it to precision timer
